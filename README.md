# Training-React
These are the small projects that I made while following the Udemy course 'Modern React with Redux [2019 Update]' by Stephen Grider.

## Usage
To use the web applications download/clone the repository and navigate to one of the applications' root directories in a command shell and run 'npm start', the web application should then open in your browser.
